<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

<div><p><span class="tncNumStyle">1.3</span></p></div><div class="tncTextSpace"><p> At the beginning of each event we will go through some rules regarding the animals. Then before each animal is taken around to be held, our professional handler will show everyone how to correctly hold each animal. Please note participants will only be allowed to hold the animals if they have listened carefully to the instructions on how to handle them to ensure a safe and happy experience for both our animals and participants.</p></div>

</div>

2 Event Environment

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

2.1 No bouncy castles or other inflatables nearby (within 40 meters).

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

2.2 Music needs to be kept to a minimum, if possible no music. We must not be positioned next to speakers.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

2.3 No balloons in reach of participants, decorative balloons are ok but none in reach of children incase they get popped.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

2.4 If there are other activities to keep the children entertained e.g. toys/games etc. these must not be brought near the animals at any time.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

2.5 Venue should be indoors unless you have stated to us that you request it outdoors, the venue will only be outdoors if the weather is suitable and the animals can be heated correctly.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

2.5.1 To be heated correctly we will require either electric for heat mats to be plugged into or boiling water to refill hot water bottles.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

2.6 If you hire a venue it is your responsibility to make sure that they allow animals on the premises. If we arrive and are denied access to the venue, you (the client) will still be responsible for the full cost of the booking.

</div>

3 Parking

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

3.1 Parking will be required on the drive if possible so we can safely unload our animals. For events where a drive isn’t available we will need to be parked as close to the doors as possible. At galas/fun days and similar events our vehicle must be able to park adjacent to our gazebo.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

3.2 Free parking must be available. If there is no free parking available then you (the client) will be responsible for the parking fee.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

3.3 If there is nowhere to park we might not be able to carry out your booking, in this case you (the client) will still be responsible for the full cost of the booking. Therefore we advise that you reserve us a space by the entrance.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

3.4 If we are late starting the event due to parking issues we still have to finish the event at the end of your allocated time slot, as there might be other bookings for that day. You (the client) will still be responsible for the full cost of the booking. Please make sure we have somewhere suitable to park.

</div>

4 Participants

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

4.2 (Schools)

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

4.3 (All participants)

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

4.3.1 Participants MUST NOT torment other participants about animals they may be afraid of.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

4.3.2 All participants MUST wash their hands BEFORE and AFTER handling the animals. We will provide hand sanitizer gel for during the event but after the event has finished it’s important that you wash your hands with warm soapy water.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

4.3.3 We request that if there is food at the event that you wait until after the animals have been shown and are back in their travel carriers until the food is brought out.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

4.3.3.1 Participants MUST NOT eat during the event. If someone does eat it is very important they wash their hands before handling any more animals. If your hands smell of food the animals might want a nibble so please keep your hands clean.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

4.3.4 All participants MUST remain seated unless a professional handler asks you to stand for certain animals.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

4.3.5 Whilst holding any animal you MUST stay with the professional handler and NOT walk away.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

4.3.6 When the animals are in their travel carriers we ask that nobody taps on the travel carriers or pokes their fingers through the gaps.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

4.3.6.1 If someone does put any part of their body next to or inside the travel carriers without permission we cannot be held responsible for any injuries incurred.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

4.3.6.2 Please do not pick up any travel carriers unless you have asked and been granted permission by a professional handler to do so.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

4.3.7 Participants must take it in turn one at a time to pet or hold each animal. If everyone tries to interact with an animal at the same time this can cause stress and discomfort to the animal.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

4.3.8 All participants will have the opportunity to pet or hold each animal unless a member of staff says otherwise. We will return animals to their travel carriers if they start to show signs of stress, please understand this is for the animal’s welfare and the safety of the participants.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

4.3.9 We reserve the right to end any encounter at any time if we see behaviour from participants that could put a member of staff or an animal in danger. Any action that affects the welfare of our animals will not be tolerated. Please note that if this happens then you (the client) will still be responsible for the full cost of the booking.

</div>

5 Allocated time slot

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

5.1 When a booking is made you are paying for the allocated time slot and not the amount of time.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

5.2 For parties and other smaller events we will arrive approximately 15 minutes prior to the event starting in order to unload the animals into the venue.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

5.3 For schools or other larger events that require a display setting up we will arrive at least 40 minutes prior to the event starting.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

5.4 Please ensure that all the participants are ready to start at the beginning of the time slot.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

5.5 If we do have to start late due to late arrivers we cannot over run the session past the allocated time slot.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

5.6 So we can start on time we request that all participants have washed their hands before we begin. If participants have not washed their hands they will have to do so at the beginning of the session, therefore resulting in less time to interact with the animals.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

5.7 In the unlikely event that we (Animal House Zoo) are late arriving to your event we will make sure that you get the full amount of interaction time with the animals that you booked for.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

8.6 If either party uses a force majeure as an excuse for the encounter to be cancelled then that party must prove that the event occurred and that they took reasonable steps to minimize delay or damages caused by foreseeable events.

</div>

<div class="tncNumberBigBox">

8.7 If a party is cancelling an encounter due to an event listed in clause 8.1 then that party must notify the other party at the first opportunity.
