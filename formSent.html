 <h3>At Animal House Zoo the safety and well-being of our animals is of paramount importance to us. We therefore strickly adhere to the 5 freedoms:</h3> 

      <ul class="text-center">

        <li><span class="makeMeBoldScotty">FREEDOM FROM HUNGER AND THIRST</span><br> All our animals have ready
          access to fresh water and a species-specific diet in order to maintain health
        and vigour.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="makeMeBoldScotty">FREEDOM FROM DISCOMFORT</span><br> All our animals have an appropriate
        environment that includes shelter and a comfortable resting area.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="makeMeBoldScotty">FREEDOM FROM PAIN, INJURY OR DISEASE</span><br> All our animals are seen
          everyday so a rapid diagnosis and treatment can be given if they become ill.
          They are also housed, fed and cared for correctly in order to prevent any pain,
        injury or disease.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="makeMeBoldScotty">FREEDOM TO EXPRESS NORMAL BEHAVIOUR</span><br> All our animals have
          more than the minimum recommended space, proper facilities, appropriate
          enrichment and company of animals of its own kind (if they are not a solitary
        species).</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="makeMeBoldScotty">FREEDOM FROM FEAR AND DISTRESS</span><br> All our animals are kept in
          conditions that keep them comfortable and stress free. On encounters, if any
          of our animals are in a situation where they could become stressed they will
        immediately be returned to their travel carriers to prevent discomfort.</li>
